# Vulnera Rust – High-Performance Vulnerability Analysis API

Vulnera is a fast, scalable, multi-ecosystem vulnerability analysis toolkit and testing platform built in Rust. While it excels at analyzing dependency manifests, Vulnera is intended as a comprehensive vulnerability analysis and testing toolkit—supporting not only dependency scanning, but also future features like codebase auditing, security testing, and integration with CI/CD workflows. It aggregates results from OSV, NVD, and GHSA, and exposes a robust HTTP API with OpenAPI docs. Designed for cloud-native workflows, Vulnera leverages async Rust, domain-driven design, and smart caching for reliability and speed.

## 🛠️ Usage

- **API Docs:** [http://localhost:3000/docs](http://localhost:3000/docs)
- **Health Check:** [http://localhost:3000/health](http://localhost:3000/health)

### Example: Analyze a Dependency File

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"file_content": "django==3.2.0\nrequests>=2.25.0", "ecosystem": "PyPI", "filename": "requirements.txt"}'
```

### Example: Analyze a GitHub Repository

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/analyze/repository \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"repository_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo", "ref": "main"}'
```

## 📦 Supported Ecosystems & File Formats

- **Python:** `requirements.txt`, `Pipfile`, `pyproject.toml`
- **Node.js:** `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`
- **Java:** `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`
- **Rust:** `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`
- **Go:** `go.mod`, `go.sum`
- **PHP:** `composer.json`, `composer.lock`

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

- Configurable via TOML files in `config/` and environment variables (prefix `VULNERA__`)
- Profiles: `development`, `staging`, `production` (set via `ENV`)
- Example environment overrides:
  ```bash
  VULNERA__SERVER__PORT=8080
  VULNERA__CACHE__TTL_HOURS=24
  VULNERA__APIS__NVD__API_KEY=your_nvd_api_key
  VULNERA__APIS__GHSA__TOKEN=your_github_token
  ```

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design

Vulnera is built with **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and a layered architecture:

- **Domain Layer:** Pure business logic, entities, value objects
- **Application Layer:** Use cases, orchestration, error mapping
- **Infrastructure Layer:** API clients, parsers, caching, repositories
- **Presentation Layer:** HTTP API, DTOs, OpenAPI, middleware

**Core Flow:**
Dependency file → Parser → AggregatingVulnerabilityRepository (parallel API calls, merge results) → AnalysisReport → Optional reporting/caching.

**Caching:**
Filesystem-based, SHA256 keys, TTL configurable. Always use provided cache key helpers.

**Error Handling:**
Early mapping to domain/application errors, graceful degradation, and clear API responses.

## 🧑‍💻 Development & Contribution

- **Dev Setup:**
  ```bash
  make -C scripts/build_workflow install-deps
  pre-commit install
  make dev
  ```
- **Testing:**
  `make test` (unit/integration), `make ci-check` (lint, format, audit)
- **Contribution:**
  Fork, branch, code, test, document, PR. Follow DDD, Rust best practices, and update OpenAPI docs for API changes.

---

## 🚢 Deployment

- **Docker:**

  ```bash
  docker build -t vulnera-rust .
  docker run -p 3000:3000 vulnera-rust
  ```
- **Kubernetes:**
  See example deployment YAML in this repo.
- **Production:**
  Harden config, disable docs, restrict CORS, provide API keys.

---

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- HTTPS for all external API calls
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and abuse protection
- Runs as non-root in containers
- Secure API key management

---

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

- **Build errors:** Update Rust, install system dependencies
- **API rate limits:** Provide API keys for OSV/NVD/GHSA
- **Cache issues:** Clear `.vulnera_cache` or adjust TTL
- **Debugging:**
  ```bash
  VULNERA__LOGGING__LEVEL=debug cargo run
  ```

---

## 📜 Changelog & Roadmap

- **v3.0.0:** Rust rewrite, multi-ecosystem, async, aggregation, caching, OpenAPI, Docker/K8s
- **Planned:** ML-powered risk scoring, webhook integrations, Redis cache, advanced reporting, plugin system, **VSCode extension** for in-editor vulnerability analysis

---

## 🦀 Why Rust? (vs Python)

Vulnera was rewritten from Python to Rust for several reasons:

- **Performance:** Rust is compiled and memory-safe, enabling much faster analysis and lower latency than Python’s interpreter.
- **Concurrency:** Tokio async runtime allows true parallelism and efficient IO, while Python’s async is limited by the GIL.
- **Reliability:** Rust’s strict type system and error handling prevent many runtime bugs common in Python.
- **Security:** Rust eliminates entire classes of memory safety vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, use-after-free) that can affect Python extensions.
- **Scalability:** Rust’s async and concurrency model scales to thousands of requests with minimal resources.
- **Ecosystem:** Rust’s package ecosystem (crates.io) and tooling (cargo, clippy, rustfmt) support modern development practices.

**Legacy Python:**
The original Vulnera was written in Python for rapid prototyping, but hit limits in performance, reliability, and maintainability. The Rust rewrite delivers a robust, production-grade backend for cloud-native deployments.

## 🌐 Azure Cloud Architecture

![Azure Architecture](./docs/Azure_Arch.png)

**Summary:**
Vulnera is designed for cloud-native deployment on Microsoft Azure.

- Edge: Azure Front Door for global entry, TLS, and WAF
- Identity: Entra Managed Identities for workload identity (no secrets in code)
- API Gateway: Azure API Management for routing, throttling, policies, and versioning
- Compute: Azure App Service or Azure Container Apps for running the Rust API
- Images: Azure Container Registry (ACR) for container images
- Secrets: Azure Key Vault for API keys and configuration
- Observability: Application Insights + Azure Monitor dashboards and logs
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions builds the app and container, pushes to ACR, and deploys to App Service/Container Apps; APIM can be updated as part of the pipeline

This architecture provides global reach, strong identity and secret management, and first-class observability while keeping operations streamlined.
